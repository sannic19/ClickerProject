# ClickerProject
- Using JavaFx
- There were 5 members in this group that each made their own contributions.

-
- Motivations / Thoughts when making the app:
-
- We knew we wanted to create a simple app that people could use to physically destress, such as that of a fidget spinner.
- Some games are too intense / mind-utilizing to play while just attempting to relax. So the clicker approach ensures that
- the user does as they please and has the ability to mindlessly play.
-
- What does the app do?
-
- This app is a simple pizza clicker application that people can play to enjoy an non-intense, relaxing game.
- Within the app there is a point system where the user can upgrade the clicker or cursor, allowing them to upgrade and play
- until they beat the game.
-
- Structure:
-
- We did not use any external APIs.
- This app contains two classes, one has the GUI (Graphic User Interface) and the other has the game logic.
- We used JavaFX in creating this project, with JavaFX it was very easy to create a friendly GUI.
-
- Other comments / credits:
-
- We quickly learned that Git is an important piece of technology to utilize in the end as we did most of our coding in our
- own IDEs. Learning to stay updated with push/pull is still a work in progress but we still managed to get the code together.
